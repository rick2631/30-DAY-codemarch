    <h3 style="color: chartreuse;">Proyecto food</h3>
    <p>In this individual project, I had the opportunity to work on developing an application using a food API. The main objective was to implement filters for different diets, create a form to add new recipes, and display details for each recipe. To achieve this, I utilized technologies such as Node.js, React, Express, and Redux, among others.</p>

    <p>Our application offers gyms the ability to create and share personalized exercise routines for their clients. Users can access the application, view the available routines, and select the ones that align with their fitness goals and level of physical fitness. Additionally, the application provides videos and detailed descriptions of each exercise to ensure proper and safe execution.</p>
